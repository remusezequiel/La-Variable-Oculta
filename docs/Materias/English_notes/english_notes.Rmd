Very often the past ends in *ed* (regular verbs)

*We invited them to our party, but they decided not to come.*

-> But many verbs are irregular (2Â° Column)

* Write -> wrote

* go -> went

In questions or negatives we use *did*, *didn't* + 'infinitive'.

>> I enjoy*ed* the party
>>
>> They *went* ton the party
>
> Questions: 
>
>> *Did* + person + verb (infinitive) + ...
>
> Negative:
>
>> Person + *didn't* + verb (infinitive) + ...

The past of *Be* is *was -> am, is (singular)* and *were -> are (plural)*

We use the past simple for:

* An action which happened at a definite time in the past. 
**Example:** They went camping by the lake last month.

* Actions which happened inmediately one after the other in the past. 
**Example: ** First she paid the driver, then she get out of the taxi.

*Past habits or states which are now finished (but we can also use the expression used to)
**Example: ** Kitchens were very different a hundred years ago.

We use past simple with the following time expresions:
